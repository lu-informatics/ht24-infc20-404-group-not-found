The purpose of our system is for it to work as a simple restaurant ordering system in which the user (somebody employed by the restaurant) 
can see all the dishes available, see all the drinks available. Create a receipt that takes in one drink and one food item and also print old receipts. 
The user is also able to change the stock amount of a certain drink and the user can also delete a dish or drink from the system.
